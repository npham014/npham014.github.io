        testimonial: "Despite not having any prior cloud computing or JavaScript experience, Nathan hit the ground running as a software engineering intern on my team and implemented some critical functions in his short time at Beautycounter. When laying out a new task for him, I always gave Nathan the chance to work things through himself first or pair program, and to my delight, he always eagerly chose the former. \n With that said, he didn't hesitate to call on me when he'd exhausted all options and needed some help getting unblocked. In my opinion, this combination of grit and prudent time sensitivity is exactly what you want to see in engineers at any stage of their career, and Nathan already exhibits it naturally. Given the opportunity, I would definitely hire Nathan in the future and am excited to see where his burgeoning career takes him.",
